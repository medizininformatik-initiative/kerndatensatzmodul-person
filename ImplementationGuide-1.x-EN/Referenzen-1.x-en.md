## References

The modeling of the dataset for the PERSON module contains references to the following projects:

* Collaborative Project *Verbesserung der Versorgung in der Akutmedizin in Deutschland durch den Aufbau eines Nationalen Notaufnahmeregisters* ([AKTIN](https://art-decor.org/art-decor/decor-project--aktin- ))
* [Verordnungsmanagement](https://art-decor.org/art-decor/decor-project--vomgt-) for the electronic prescription of remedies and aids as well as home health care. Of these, the header data were taken into account.
* International Patient Summary ([IPS](http://international-patient-summary.net/)). The individual references to the [IPS-ART-DECOR Project](https://art-decor.org/art-decor/decor-project--hl7ips-) can be found at the corresponding data elements of the Person module.

The [HL7 FHIR Core Specification](http://hl7.org/fhir/), including the corresponding resource [Patient](http://hl7.org/fhir/patient.html), and previous work on the German Basic Profiles in [STU3](https://simplifier.net/basisprofilde) and [R4](https://simplifier.net/basisprofil-de-r4) have also been considered. 

The present specification was designed based on the description of the MII core dataset in the version of 10.3.2017 [(PDF)](https://www.medizininformatik-initiative.de/sites/default/files/inline-files/MII_04_Kerndatensatz_1-0.pdf), as well as the dataset description in [ART-DECOR](https://art-decor.org/art-decor/decor-project--mide-).
