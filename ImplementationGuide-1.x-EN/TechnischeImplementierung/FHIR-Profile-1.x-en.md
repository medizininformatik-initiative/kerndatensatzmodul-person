## FHIR profiles

The core data set specification is based, as far as possible, on international standards and terminologies. In particular, the [International Patient Summary](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ips/history.html) should be emphasized here. Adaptation to the general conditions of the German health care system is achieved by using the [German Basic Profiles](https://simplifier.net/guide/basisprofil-de-r4/home) of HL7 Germany.

All elements of the core data set, adapted to the details and requirements for the use cases of the Medical Informatics Initiative, are described below in the form of FHIR StructureDefinitions. The necessity of adapting the FHIR profiles is explained in textual form below the respective profiles.
