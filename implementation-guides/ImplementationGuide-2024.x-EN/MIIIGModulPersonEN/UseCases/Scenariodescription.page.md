## Description of scenarios for the usage within the modules

The following three use cases highlight exemplary situation where the module PERSON can be applied:

1. External record linkage for person-related cross-facility evaluations
1. Descriptive basic evaluations by region, gender and age
1. Risk adjustment by age and gender

Re 1: In Germany, there is no unique national, cross-purpose personal identifier. Tax codes and insured person numbers are not sufficiently widespread or stable, or may not be used within a derived scenario. Therefore, for cross-institutional person-based evaluations, a sufficiently secure linkage characteristic must be regularly implemented on a study-specific basis. Both false-positive linkages and false-negative linkages must be minimized.  The basis for this is identifiable data (IDAT) such as name, date of birth, sex and place of residence. In some use cases the IDAT may be enriched by the insurance number, or be potentially substituted by it. Identity data (IDAT) are collected and stored separately at each institution and in projects are usually communicated only to a trust center

Re 2: In studies, basic evaluations of origin (place of residence), age and sex, as well as the distribution of characteristics (e.g. a disease) according to these three variables are often of fundamental interest.

Regarding 3: Many symptoms, diseases and clincial events are dependent on age and sex. Therefore, a direct or indirect age standardization is regularly necessary for comparisons, for which the corresponding individual data items per person are required.

Due to the central relevance of the module person, the description of the application within the individual consortia is omitted.
