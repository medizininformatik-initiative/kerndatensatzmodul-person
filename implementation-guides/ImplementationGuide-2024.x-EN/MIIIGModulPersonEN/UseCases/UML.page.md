## UML

A UML class diagram was created as a more abstract version of an information model and for better clarification of relationships between the domain-oriented concepts. Concepts mapped as groups in ART-DECOR are modeled as separate classes, which here have association relationships to each other. The roles of persons in the module were assigned to the person via a class "Role", inherited from. Demographic properties of the person are color-coded from the other properties.
